`iond` is the command line client for the IDEP Network. Users are able to do multiple things including send transactions and
query blockchain data. The commands compiled in the documentation are not the exhaustive and complete list, more commands will be added in
future updates.

## Connecting to a Node

The node provides a RPC interface. Transactions and query requests are sent to the process listening to it.
The default rpc address the iond is connected to is tcp://localhost:26657, it can also be specified by --node.
