## Information Regarding SGX Compliance for VPS options and IDEP Network
This is intended to guide you in selecting SGX compliant VPS options for the IDEP Network mainnet Antora.

Note. When renting a compliant bare metal machine from a VPS provider, ensure you do not accept any chassis
or CPU substitutes they propose, unless those substitutes are on the [Hardware Compliance list](hardware-compliance).
```
Note all cost estimates are based off the following recommendations:
- Processor: E-series rather than E3 (due to age)
- SSD: 1TB+
- RAM: 32GB+
Just because a VPS is cheaper does *NOT* necessarily make it better.
