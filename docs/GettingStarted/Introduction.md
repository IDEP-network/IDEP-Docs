## What is IDEP

IDEP is a scalable Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) which utilizes the [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus engine.

IDEP's core vision is to become the first global scale, digital media, AR platform utilizing the Tendermint's PoS
implementation. IDEP Network makes this possible by creating a geo-location based AR layer that is readily integrable
with mobile devices and smart glasses. You can think of this layer as a new standard in augmented reality experiences
as well as a complimentary implementation of networks blockchain. IDEP Network core modules will have full integration
and use of this AR layer. Also, because it is so tightly integrated with the network, it will be able to be used by the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem and broader blockchain community. The Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) will give rise to exciting collaborations and use cases underpinned with IDEP's AR tech. IDEP Network adopts the open source philosophy, inviting the entire IDEP community to contribute to the growth of the network, creating a self-sustaining decentralized platform.

### Features

Heres a quick look at some of the exciting features of IDEP:

* Native Location-based Augmented Reality via Senary App (Coming Soon)
* AR focused cross-platform universal digital asset [standards](https://github.com/IDEP-network/Galactic-Standards/blob/main/GS1.md)
* High throughput using Tendermint Core
* Horizontal scalability enabled with [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org)

IDEP enables these key features by:

* Exposing a fully interoperable Augmented Reality layer for interacting with existing and future NFT and digital asset projects.
* Implementing Tendermint Core's Application Blockchain Interface [(ABCI)](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/) to interact with the blockchain.
* Leveraging the modules concept and other mechanisms implemented by the Cosmos SDK.
* Utilizing native EVM and WASM modules to quickly onboard dapp developers.

These exciting features will allow IDEP to revolutionize how we build the next generation of Augmented Reality
experiences and pave way for a new and exciting Cosmos ecosystem's future.
