If you have questions or are having trouble setting up or using your wallet of choice, please make sure you've read
through all the relevant pages in our Wallet Guide. The IDEP team is working hard to support new wallets, and we do our best to keep our documents up to date with the latest available information.

If you have questions after reading the docs, feel free to reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/IDEPNetwork).

For technical support, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Jrarctk4hG).
